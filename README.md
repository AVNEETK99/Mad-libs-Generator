# Mad-libs-Generator

A Mad Libs generator project is a program that prompts the user to provide various types of words (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) and then uses those words to create a humorous story or paragraph. Mad Libs are a type of word game that typically involves filling in the blanks of a pre-written story with words of a certain type, such as nouns, verbs, or adjectives. The resulting story often ends up being humorous or absurd, depending on the words chosen by the player.

## Instructions to run the game

* Open the Github repository where the game code is hosted.

* Click on the green "Code" button and then select "Download ZIP" to download the code as a ZIP file.

* Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.

* Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the folder where you extracted the code.

* Type ```python mad.py``` and press Enter to start the game.

* Follow the prompts to play the game.

## Functionality of the code

* The first two lines are just comments that describe what the program does.
* The variable loop is initialized to 1.
* The while loop runs as long as the value of loop is less than 10. This means that the loop will execute 9 times.
* Inside the loop, the program prompts the user to input various words such as nouns, plural nouns, adjectives, etc.
* The program then prints out a story using the user's input. The story is a Mad Libs-style story where the user's words are substituted for certain words in the story.
* After printing out the story, the loop increments the value of loop by 1, so that the loop will eventually end after 9 iterations.
